      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am an 18-year-old first-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Business Systems at VIT Vellore. I am eagerly anticipating new experiences, meeting new people, and learning new things. While the concept of Computer Science is currently new to me, I find it incredibly interesting, and the prospect of pursuing it in the coming years fills me with excitement.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for making music. I began learning music production online through YouTube tutorials using the software FL Studio back in 2017. Now, I professionally release original music under the alias "Alpha Morris."</p>
      
      <p>My music has reached a wide audience, with over 500,000 listeners online, and my songs have been streamed more than 3,000,000 times on platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Pandora, Beatport, Tidal, and many others.</p>
      
      <p>I also offer services on websites like Fiverr and Soundbetter, specializing in audio mixing, mastering, and sound design. I've had the privilege of collaborating with artists not only in India but also from different countries. I have even signed some of my tracks with major labels like Universal Music and Sony Music.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to music and engineering, I have a keen interest in graphic design and video editing. I constantly seek out new challenges to facilitate my personal growth, and I diligently follow the Pomodoro technique to enhance my learning efficiency.</p>
